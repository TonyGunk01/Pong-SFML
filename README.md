# Pong-SFML

Pong is one of the most important games in video game history, it became a huge hit in arcade machines and then made its way to home console systems.

Here I have programmed the game Pong in C++ using SFML (Simple and Fast Mulitmedia Library). Code was categorized into two broad folders: header and source. Header contains all header files (ending with .h), source contains all class files (ending with .cpp)

Since I'm rendering data/graphics on screen every frame, I used lifecycle functions to handle different tasks. Also appropriate namespaces were used which would contain classes so that referencing can be done more efficiently between different classes in different files. 

The gameplay is super simple, use up and down arrow keys to move the paddle up and down respectively.
